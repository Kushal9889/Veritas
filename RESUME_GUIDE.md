## 🎯 ATS Scanning Tips

✅ **Use standard section headers:** "Projects" or "Technical Projects"  
✅ **Include keywords** from job descriptions naturally  
✅ **Avoid graphics/tables** in actual resume (use plain text)  
✅ **Use standard fonts** (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)  
✅ **Save as .docx or .pdf** (check ATS compatibility)  
✅ **Spell out acronyms** first time: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)"

**Pro Tip:** Tailor the bullet points based on the job description. If applying for:
- **AI/ML roles** → Use Option 1 or 2 (emphasize LLMs, RAG, embeddings)
- **Data Engineering** → Use Option 3 (emphasize pipelines, databases, ETL)
- **Software Engineering** → Use Option 4 (emphasize architecture, optimization, production)
